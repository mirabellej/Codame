Instructions for Use:
Click the big green CODE button and select "download as zip." This will download a zip file to your computer. Unzip the file. To run sketches, double click on the file. Arduino may ask you to relocate the sketch to another folder. Click "OK." This will open up the sketch in the Arduino IDE. Make sure you have the correct port and board selected for your Circuit Playground Express, then click the forward button to upload the sketch to the Circuit Playground Express. 

Class 4 PREREQUISITES

PREREQUISITES: Prior to class students should complete the following. This will allow us to jump right in!

    Download TouchDesigner and sign up for a free license so you can use the software! Feel free to have a look at some introductory tutorials beforehand, especially if you are completely new to using TouchDesigner. I also highly recommend this series by Matthew Ragan.
    Make sure you have a working webcam! A webcam is needed for this class as the goal is to manipulate a camera feed! It can be a built-in webcam or an external camera that connects to your computer—either is fine! You can test whether your camera is working in TouchDesigner by using the Video Device In TOP.
    Recommended: download some video files you want to make art with! For some places to grab royalty free video, I recommend the following sources: MazWai, Pexels, Coverr, Videvo, Mixkit, Pixabay, Videezy. You can also download any of the videos I’ll be using for examples (Pexel user listed) from Drive here.
    Recommended: I recommend using a mouse with a scroll wheel in TouchDesigner but this is not required.
    If you want to jump ahead, feel free to download the files from Github. They will be available Saturday 9/19.
